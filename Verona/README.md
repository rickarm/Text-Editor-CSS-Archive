# Verona

A pretty dark theme for Espresso, Mou, Terminal.app and iTerm. Your eyeballs will thank you.

## Verona GTD
Verona GTD for Mou adds changes heading colors while keeping the font size the same in order to label scheduled (red), projects (blue), and contexts (green) for use with Getting Things Done.
